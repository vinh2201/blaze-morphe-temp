# 👋🧩 FTL Patches

Personal collection of my Morphe Patches

## ❓ About

Strips ads and analytics/crash-reporting SDKs at the bytecode level, cleans build artifacts and dex debug info, trims resource bloat — unused density buckets, unused language packs, lossless PNG recompression — and lets you scale the app's display density independent of system settings, for smaller, cleaner APKs.
